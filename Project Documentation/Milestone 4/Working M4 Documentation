Product Summary:

Suffering from a “Netflix hangover”? We know post-binge-watching blues is real, especially in the modern age of quarantine. After investing so much time into a captivating show and immersing into a reality outside of your own, a wave of emptiness washes over after realizing you just finished an entire series. Filled with so many questions, comments, and concerns about the show and an urge to further discuss, there must be an outlet to fill this new-found void, hence our development of Chatflix! Chatflix is social network which emphasizes the connection amongst fans of the film and entertainment industry.

Chatflix allows you to connect with an online community of avid “bingers” and movie enthusiasts alike to converse over the television series or motion pictures recently added to their just-watched lists. After you register to the Chatflix web site, you would have your own profile on which you could share some fun information about yourself, and you would also be able to share your thoughts about a TV show’s season premiere, for example, on a discussion thread by either creating your own post or responding to another registered user’s post. Simply search for a TV show or movie by title using the Chatflix Search feature, then visit the Series Information page provided in the search results. Finally, to access all the buzz, select the Discussion feature from the Series Information page, then indulge in the latest gossip about your favorite scene, character, plot twist, the list is endless!
