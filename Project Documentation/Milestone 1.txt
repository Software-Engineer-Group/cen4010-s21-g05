      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
      
      Suffering from a ‘Netflix hangover’? We know post-binge-watching blues is real, especially in the modern age of quarantine. After investing so much time into a captivating show and immersing into a reality outside of your own, a wave of emptiness washes over when you realize you had just finished watching the final episode. Filled with so many questions, comments, and concerns about the show and an urge to further discuss, there must be an outlet to fill this new-found void. We know its all you can think about for days post-binge, hence our development of Chatflix! 

      Chatflix will be a social-networking site that will make it easy for you to connect and share with virtually anyone. The main concept is to build an online community of avid bingers and movie enthusiasts alike to openly chat about any show or movie. Not only will be this be a ‘fan forum’, but users will be able to create their own customizable profile, add friends, subscribe to their favorite show or movie’s page, stay up to date with an activity feed, leave reviews, keep track with a watch-list queue, interact in a watch party and more! The purpose is to build a broad social network with emphasis on creating a sense of connection and interaction amongst fellow fans of the film entertainment industry.

      Within the social media market there is little room for change when considering overall features, although a focus on target audience is what makes and breaks a
competitive social media platform. For example, Facebook competitor Instagram have similar concepts of user posts, profiles, and user media feeds but the difference is seen by
the site’s userbase. Facebook hosts many user, typically older than thirty and was seen as a replacement for Myspace, while Instagram is a social media setting where many
generation Z user flock to; fleeing from Facebook. With the same principle of focusing on an audience rather then features, ChatFlix aims to replace Media giants like IMBD and
Rotten Tomatoes. By focusing on pop culture and simplistic modern design, Chatflix can appeal to many teens and young adults: a platforms that promotes internet pop culture with
a focus on movies and shows.
